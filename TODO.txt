Move flowerpot stuff from Plants to Apotheosis.
Target brewing?  Not sure what to do there.
More stuff involving obscure vanilla materials (prismarine, chorus, shulker, rabbit).
Probably document this stuff.
Maybe more vanilla-esque enchantments. (Current Task)

Potions/recipes/types for:
Health Boost
Saturation (maybe, might not do this one)

Levitation
Luck + Unluck (+- Pair)

Add a way to get treasure enchantments.
Prismatic Altar: Created out of prismarine crystals / shards, can be used to transmute three+ enchanted books into a treasure enchantment.
This altar takes four enchanted objects, and then drains a certain amount of XP from nearby players.
Once XP has been provided (XP count will be determined by level of provided objects.  Stronger objects == less XP), the books will be transmuted into a Treasure Book.
Treasure Books will randomly grant one Treasure enchant when grabbed from the altar.
[Bug] Altar needs to drop items/xp when broken.

Bosses with AI to attack villagers should have that AI stripped.
