Affix based manipulation system in the smithing table.
An item similar to a tome can be used to remove a single affix at a time from an affix item.
-Removed affix is random from the affixes on the item.
-Has a chance to degrade the affix, but an upgraded version of the item can negate this chance.
This same item can be used to reapply affixes to other items.

Another item that will upgrade a random affix on the item.

The ability to scrap items for rarity tokens that are used in the crafting of affix-based modification systems.

Another item that will upgrade the tier of the item.

And a final item that will allow for a reroll of the item, including all affix data.

--Maybe make a new table for this (or modify the smithing table, or something).

---Suggestions---

 Some sort of item to directly upgrade 1 enchantment by 1 level. 
 Maybe a sort of legendary tome that can be enchanted or combined with
 books in order to make a sort of "tier up" for a certain enchant. 
 Would be nice for maxing out items via slow and steady progress rather than chance.
 
 a "payload" enchantment for crossbows that increases the damage of firework rockets?
 
 
 some changes to lapis, because it piles up really fast and you never
 actually have to worry about running out of it (configurable "fuel"
 for ench table or something else optional to make the ench process in general more end-gamish) 
 or rare temporary buffs to new table stats
 
 trident had a damage increasing enchant. One that wasn't specific to certain mobs 
 
 Allow enchantment name color to be changed as part of enchantments.cfg
