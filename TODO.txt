Move flowerpot stuff from Plants to Apotheosis.
Target brewing?  Not sure what to do there.
More stuff involving obscure vanilla materials (prismarine, chorus, shulker, rabbit).
Probably document this stuff.
Maybe more vanilla-esque enchantments. (Current Task)

Potions/recipes/types for:
Health Boost
Saturation (maybe, might not do this one)
Glowing
Levitation
Luck + Unluck (+- Pair)

Refactor enchantability numbers.  Not entirely sure how this system works, but want to make Masterworks need > 30. 

Prismatic Web (Prismarine + Cobweb) to remove curses?

Configurable numbers for enchantments.  Talking about values, not enchantability.
